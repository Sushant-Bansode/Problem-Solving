Amazing Solution Using Bit Masking
Actually We Convert the Given Array elements into the Binary Nos, Via Bit Masking them and, mapping the Respective Elements ith Index witht the -> ith BIT as SET BIT, So Here Typically All We do is that
Get the Subset Count by, 1<<n;
then After that we, Simply Create That much No. of BITMASKS, Via loop and Simultaneously Check the Total SET bits with the postion and Puch Back Corresponsing BITMASKS, Converted into NUMS[i].
Then SUBSETS GENERATION USING BIT MASK DONeeeeeeeeeee......
