O(N^2) Typical Solution
Sorted 2 Arrays, and picked 1 Array then, checked in 1 Array if a[i] == a[i-1] Continue to Avoid Repeatition in a array and Then looped entirely in 2nd array and checked if
a[i] == b[j], then pushback into vector answer and to avoid repeatiton in array 2 just, Break loop after 1st time the condition is verified.
