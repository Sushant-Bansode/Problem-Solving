This is a two liner solution for the problem.

Time Complexity: O(1)

Explaination
Let's take n=21
​
Now in bit format, n=10101
On right shifting the bits by 1, n becomes 1010
​
Now, if we take the XOR of both the above numbers,
x = 10101 ^ 1010
x = 11111
​
This number will have all bits as 1 only if, we had alternating bits in question.
​
To check if all bits are 1, we will add 1 to x,
x = 11111
x+1 = 100000
​
On using AND (&) operation on both these, the result should be 0, and hence the answer is true.
​
Solution:
class Solution {
public:
bool hasAlternatingBits( int n ) {
long x = ( n^( n >> 1) );
return !( x & ( x+1 ) );
}
};
