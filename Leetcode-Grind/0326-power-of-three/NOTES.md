double power = log10(n) / log10(4);
// This Statement means, 4^Power = n;
// Just taken Log on Both the sides...
​
double check = fmod(power,1);
//This Statement Means to Verify if the Power which is Obtained above by taking Log on //the Both sides, is it Really an interger, for that basically what we do is This Double type //output Giver, Function fmod, Takes in 2, Double INputs and Returns 1st MODULO 2nd,
// And for the Perfect integer n, n%1 == 0, Common Sense Right..............
​
// And then  simply do if-else to check if obtained modulo 1 is ZERO or NOT....
// THIS NINJA TECHNIQUE CAN BE USED TO FIND IF ANYONE IS POWER OF ANYONE...
